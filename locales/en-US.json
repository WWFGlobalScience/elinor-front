Ostrom and her colleagues countered the dominant narrative around the tragedy of the commons (which argued that individuals pursue their own interest even when it goes against the collective good—made famous by an ecologist who was a known racist and eugenicist). Ostrom’s theory on governing the commons proved that our planet could be protected through community, collaboration, and cooperation.",

Working in true partnership with others who understood the world in different ways, Ostrom and her colleagues paved the way for a new research community and body of knowledge that embraces diversity and the intertwined nature of human and natural systems.",

When resources for more comprehensive governance or management assessments are not available, insights from this tool help project teams make decisions about what activities to carry out. </p><p> For regional and international decision-makers, the tool can help provide a broad overview of perceived status and trends in management and governance and help identify areas for future regional-level research. Decision-makers might come from different types of organizations, and may include NGO or government staff, consultants, and researchers. </p>",
