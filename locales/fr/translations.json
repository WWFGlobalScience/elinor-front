            "paragraph1": "Elinor Ostrom was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in economics in 2009, but her legacy extends far beyond that singular honor. Ostrom and her colleagues countered the dominant narrative around the tragedy of the commons (which argued that individuals pursue their own interest even when it goes against the collective good—made famous by an ecologist who was a known racist and eugenicist). Ostrom’s theory on governing the commons proved that our planet could be protected through community, collaboration, and cooperation.",
            "paragraph2": "Research on the governance of common pool resource management pushed boundaries of science and challenged the usual divisions between disciplines. Working in true partnership with others who understood the world in different ways, Ostrom and her colleagues paved the way for a new research community and body of knowledge that embraces diversity and the intertwined nature of human and natural systems.",
            "paragraph3": "Ostrom’s legacy shapes how we work today in conservation, and by honoring her in our work, we hope that her insights can help us all better support both the communities and governance systems that protect our natural resources now and into the future.",

For those with the time and capacity to gather diverse perspectives on management and governance, we recommend downloading the Elinor assessment tool and protocol to guide your efforts.",
      "paragraph3": "This guidance offers insights on how to ethically lead a group, obtain the right permissions for using the data, and to probe for diverse perspectives; especially of those who may have been traditionally marginalized. This is the preferred pathway, as it allows diverse voices to contribute to the assessment, providing a more holistic perspective on the status of management and governance in an area.",

While a desk-based assessment offers a limited option, it allows for some data to be generated on the managed area, which can provide an often adequate and helpful assessment on the current status and trends in the area, and can help users identify any critical knowledge gaps that would require further research and investment. Should you choose to take this pathway, allocate time for you and your colleagues familiar with the MA to discuss and answer each question, based on your experience and knowledge of the MA. If possible, we recommend engaging different stakeholders in whatever way you can to gain insights on the different questions.",
