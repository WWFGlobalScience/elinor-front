On the ElinorData.org website, you will find a full field protocol that can be used to guide ethical data collection with stakeholders. This guidance offers insights on how to ethically lead a group, obtain the right permissions for using the data, and to probe for diverse perspectives; especially of those who may have been traditionally marginalized. This is the preferred pathway, as it allows diverse voices to contribute to the assessment, providing a more holistic perspective on the status of management and governance in an area. See the Elinor assessment tool and protocol for guidance on how to lead a focus group.</li><li><strong>As a desk based assessment.</strong> This pathway is for those who have limited time or resources for carrying out a participatory focus group. This option allows for some data to be generated on the managed area, which can provide an often adequate and helpful assessment on the current status and trends in the area, and can help users identify any critical knowledge gaps that would require further research and investment.</li></ol>When inputting data into the ElinorData system, users can indicate which pathway they took to generate the data in the assessment so any future users of the data can consider who’s perspectives were represented in the data.",
