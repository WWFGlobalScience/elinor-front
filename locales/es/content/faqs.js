                  The main purpose of Elinor is to track attributes critical to the success of area-based conservation
                  over time,and share this information with decision makers and conservation supporters working at local,
                  national or international scales.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The tool was specifically designed knowing many conservation practitioners (1) are familiar with and
                  use an adopted version of the METT in their work and (2) face budget and time constraints for conservation
                  monitoring and evaluation, and may need flexible  approaches for collecting standardized data.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Because of this, this low-cost and simple assessment has been developed collaboratively with members
                  of the conservation community, building off of the scoring system of the METT and questions from
                  existing protocols (see reference list), and covers a range of management and governance issue
                  considered important to success.

              <p>The Elinor assessment was initially designed to meet the needs of conservationists working for
                  non-governmental organizations (NGOs) but can be used by any individual working to support a
                  managed area. The assessment can be completed in one of two ways:

              <ol>
                  <li>
                      As a <strong>field-based focus group.</strong> This is the way that many governance assessments
                      are traditionally completed; leveraging diverse perceptions from key stakeholders involved in the
                      management and governance of a particular area. On the ElinorData.org website, you will find a full
                      field protocol that can be used to guide ethical data collection with stakeholders. This guidance
                      offers insights on how to ethically lead a group, obtain the right permissions for using the data,
                      and to probe for diverse perspectives; especially of those who may have been traditionally marginalized.
                      This is the preferred pathway, as it allows diverse voices to contribute to the assessment,
                      providing a more holistic perspective on the status of management and governance in an area.

                          resources for carrying out a participatory focus group. This option allows for some data to be
                          generated on the managed area, which can provide an often adequate and helpful assessment on
                          the current status and trends in the area, and can help users identify any critical knowledge
                          gaps that would require further research and investment.

                  are directed. A management area (MA) can be one protected area, or one conserved area (see glossary

                  Elinor includes 35 indicators across 10 core attributes of governance and management. Scores are calculated for each indicator, each attribute, and each managed area in total. Each indicator is assigned a score between 0 and 3 (with 0 being the least desirable and 4 being most desirable) on a scale that is customized for each indicator. For example, the scale for awareness of boundaries, records whether boundaries are known by most (3), some (2), a few (1) or none (0) of the relevant groups, while clearly defined boundaries, meanwhile, record whether boundaries are well demarcated (3), demarcated with some deficiencies (2), demarcated with major deficiencies (1), or not demarcated at all (0). Attribute scores, meanwhile, are calculated using a points percentage (i.e., total number of points received/total number of points possible) of indicators associated with each attribute, which is adjusted to a score out of 10 for easy interpretation. Finally, the total score for the managed area is calculated as a percentage of all attribute points received out of all attributes possible. Indicator, attribute and MA scores are assigned an action-oriented assessment category (Plan, Build, Strengthen, Maintain) to enable action-oriented interpretation. <strong>Note that the scores given by Elinor should not alone be used to determine the strengths or needs of the area's governance and management.</strong> It may be that a lower score on some attribute or indicator is sufficient for one site, but not another. The scores should be interpreted alongside the qualitative explanations entered into Elinor in order for decision-makers to choose the appropriate next steps.
