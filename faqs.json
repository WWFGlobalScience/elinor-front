The Elinor assessment was designed to mirror the METT as closely as possible, and pulls questions directly from the METT and uses the same scale. Refer to this crosswalk between the METT, SAGE and Elinor to help users understand the similarities and differences between the different tools.</p><p>If you use the METT currently, if you obtain informed consent from participants in your METT assessment, you can enter the data gathered from the METT into the Elinor database. Pay careful attention to the data privacy settings and ensure you have the rights to enter the data in the ElinorData system.</p>"

More robust analysis can be carried out on the data collected using the social science theories and frameworks that underpin the questions in this tool - namely Elinor Ostrom’s theory of common pool resource governance, equity in resource governance (e.g. Bennett and Satterfield 2018), and resilience thinking. Depending on the data privacy settings chosen by users, data from across regions will be available for public use.</p>"

If you currently collect data using field-based surveys or focus groups, you can use the data you already collect to inform the answers to the questions asked in Elinor - just make sure you have the rights and permissions to do so.

A management area refers to a site/location to which management actions are directed. A management area (MA) can be one protected area, or one conserved area (see glossary for definitions), or a broader area that encompasses several protected areas/conserved areas. </p><p>Therefore, the user of this tool may decide to conduct this assessment on:</p><ol class=\"list-inside list-disc\"> <li>An individual protected area or conserved area. For example, this could be an assessment of an area managed by a Beach Management Unit (BMU). Alternatively, it could be an assessment of a single Protected Area.</li><li>A broader sea/landscape with multiple conserved areas and protected areas and consider these as one management area, answering the questions with all of these areas in mind. For example, a Biosphere Reserve with multiple protected areas or conserved areas.</li></ol>"
