                <p>
                  The main purpose of this tool is to help conservationists
                  working in managed and conserved areas to easily track
                  components critical to the success of area-based conservation
                  over time, and share this information with decision makers and
                  conservation supporters working at national or international
                  scales.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The tool was specifically designed knowing many conservation
                  practitioners (1) are familiar with and use an adopted version
                  for the METT in their work and (2) face budget and time
                  constraints for conservation monitoring and evaluation, and
                  finally, (3) have minimal capacity to identify metrics that
                  are (a) grounded in social science (b) useful for local
                  adaptive management while also being (c) relevant for global
                  research and decision-making.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because of this, this low-cost and simple assessment has been
                  developed collaboratively with members of the conservation
                  community over two years, building on existing tools and
                  resources (see reference list), and focuses on covering a
                  range of management and governance issues considered important
                  to success rather than going in-depth in one particular area.

                  What kinds of decisions will this tool help inform?

                <p>
                  For project and site managers, information from the assessment
                  can help identify where a more in-depth assessment of
                  management, governance, equity, or climate is needed in a
                  particular site. When resources for more comprehensive
                  governance or management assessments are not available,
                  insights from this tool help project teams make decisions
                  about what activities to carry out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For regional and international decision-makers, the tool can
                  help provide a broad overview of perceived status and trends
                  in management and governance and help identify areas for
                  future regional-level research. Decision-makers might come
                  from different types of organizations, and may include NGO or
                  government staff, consultants, and researchers.

                <p>
                  The target user (who will input information in the tool) is a
                  conservation stakeholder who is knowledgeable about the
                  management and governance of a managed or conserved area.
                  Oftentimes this person will be a staff member at a
                  conservation NGO but may also be natural resource users and
                  other individuals from Indigenous Peoples, local communities,
                  and private entities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The target user should consult other stakeholders or resources
                  when filling out the tool. If the target user has more time
                  and resources, it’s possible to use this tool as a focus group
                  instrument, and invite a relevant group of stakeholders to
                  review and answer questions together. You can download the
                  facilitation guide here with tips on research ethics and
                  facilitation should you choose to take this path.

                It is also a quick and easy way to include stakeholders in part
                of the planning and decision-making process for the MA.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  Not necessarily. This tool was designed to mirror the METT as
                  closely as possible, so data collected using the METT could
                  inform inputs into the Elinor tool and database. For example,
                  if you use the METT for evalu
                  <strong>conservation and management</strong>:
                </p>
                <p>
                  1. Clearly defined rights and decision making; 2. Inclusive
                  and equitable management; 3. Transparency and accountability;
                  4. Monitoring and enforcement; 5. Clear and congruent
                  regulations; 6. Resource boundaries; 7. Perceived outcomes; 8.
                  Capacity for adaptive management; 9. Operational capacity.

                  The data system will also allow tool users to append relevant
                  documents like management plans and geospatial files to
                  facilitate knowledge management and sharing across spatial
                  scales and access decision-friendly visualizations of

                  The Elinor database and web platform will provide simple visuals at a site, regional, and international level that show trends over time, aggregated by the nine attributes listed above. More robust analysis can be carried out on the data collected using the social science theories and frameworks that underpin the questions in this tool - namely Elinor Ostrom’s theory of common pool resource governance, equity in resource governance (e.g. Bennett and Satterfield 2018), and resilience thinking.

                <p>
                  No! This tool was designed to complement in-depth, field-based data collection. If you currently collect data using field-based surveys or focus groups, you can use the data you already collect to inform the answers to the questions asked in Elinor. Conversely, information gathered using this tool can help you understand what topics require more in-depth field-based surveys.

It does not measure specific changes in laws and regulations, which may have great impacts on conservation activities in any given place. </li>

                 OK, I’m using the tool. How do I decide what ‘counts’ as a managed or conserved area?
                </h4>
                <p>
                 his depends on your context. In this tool, we refer to the boundary of the area to be assessed as the management area (MA). A management area refers to a site/location to which management actions are directed. A management area (MA) can be one protected area, or one conserved area (see glossary for definitions), or a broader area that encompasses several protected areas/conserved areas.
                </p>
                <p>Therefore, the user of this tool may decide to conduct this assessment on:</p>
                <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
                  <li>An individual protected area or conserved area. For example, this could be an assessment of an area managed by a Beach Management Unit (BMU). Alternatively, it could be an assessment of a single Protected Area. </li>
                  <li>A broader sea/landscape with multiple conserved areas and protected areas and consider these as one management area, answering the questions with all of these areas in mind. For example, a Biosphere Reserve with multiple protected areas or conserved areas.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is important to specify this decision in the background section of the survey. </p>
