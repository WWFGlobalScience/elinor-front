                <h4>What is the main purpose of the tool?</h4>
                <p>The main purpose of this tool is to help conservationists working in managed and conserved areas to easily track components critical to the success of area-based conservation over time, and share this information with decision makers and conservation supporters working at national or international scales.</p>

<p>The tool was specifically designed knowing many conservation practitioners (1) are familiar with and use an adopted version for the METT in their work and (2) face budget and time constraints for conservation monitoring and evaluation, and finally, (3) have minimal capacity to identify metrics that are (a) grounded in social science (b) useful for local adaptive management while also being (c) relevant for global research and decision-making.
</p>
<p>Because of this, this low-cost and simple assessment has been developed collaboratively with members of the conservation community over two years, building on existing tools and resources (see reference list), and focuses on covering a range of management and governance issues considered important to success rather than going in-depth in one particular area.
