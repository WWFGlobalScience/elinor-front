## Build Setup

```bash
# Use correct Node version (optional, requires NVM). This pulls the Node version from the .nvmrc file.
$ nvm use

# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

This project uses Prettier for autoformatting and Husky 3 (an older version to match current the current Node version). Prettier will run pre-commit. It is optional, but recommended that an IDE extension such as [this one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) is used to run Prettier when files are saved.
