          text: `
              We are happy to announce that the latest version of the Elinor tool (v2023.1) has been released and is ready for online use! This version contains several new exciting features. ElinorData.org can now automatically produce reports for completed assessments that provide high-level overviews of the results for easier learning and reporting. Users can also see their preliminary results update as they enter data into the system. We have made minor revisions to the assessment text, including fixing typos, edits for inclusive language, and improve clarity in question wording. Some questions have been reorganized under different attributes as well. None of these changes affect existing data already entered into the system. These features are the result of a year-long effort to continually improve the Elinor tool. We encourage you to try them out and send us any feedback you may have. Thanks so much for your continued use of ElinorData.org. We'll be back in August with more news after we present Elinor at the International Congress on Conservation Biology in Kigali, Rwanda!

              We are glad to release the first version of Elinor - v2022.1. This is the culmination of two years of work
              by both our social science and technology teams to enable users to creatively capture management and
              governance information and optionally share with a wide audience in accordance to our collaboration
              principles. This version enables users to create accounts and securely capture assessments data for
              storage in our cloud system. Details of the protocol can be found here. We have made all efforts to make
              the user interface easy and friendly to make the user focus on the main task of capturing management and
              governance information. We encourage users to review the terms of use prior to creating accounts and
              populating data. We hope that this will bring a pleasant experience and we welcome you to send us comments,
              questions and ideas through the contact form on this website. In the next phase of the web application
              we’ll bring to you reporting and visualization capabilities to enable you view and make sense of your data
              and in future releases we shall incorporate spatial data to help broaden the context of managed area
              management and governance.

          text: `
              There are many tools that can be used to assess governance and management of managed areas for area based
              conservation. Two of such tools are METT 4 and SAGE. Elinor does not replace these tools but rather
              provinces a lighter touch alternative that makes it easier to track trends over time and when fully
              developed will bring spatial components for visualizing trends and regional coverage of assessments. All
              the tools are ideally completed by focus groups by Elinor allows completion by an individual, making it
              more flexible where there are resource constraints. Elinor provides modern cloud storage capability that
              also enables easier backup and sharing of data. To determine when to use Elinor or select other tools,

          text: `
              Designing and architecting web based tools takes a lot of effort. Realizing the Elinor tool took time and
              effort from three distinct groups: scientists who researched and developed the protocol, backend engineers
              who designed the architecture to deliver a modern and stable structure and frontend developers and UX/UX
              specialists who made the tool interface flexible, beautiful and easy to use. Part of the engineering in
              based on past experience building similar tools like the MERMAID which brough efficiency and stability.
              Taking an iterative approach, we continue to consult with various stakeholders and experts both on
              engineering and science. We have made the code open source to promote collaboration and encourage all
              users to open their data for sharing but we intentionally leave the decision to share with the data owners
              while we provide a solid platform to facilitate the sharing.
